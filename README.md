## Project: Plot and Navigate a Virtual Maze

### Install
This project requires **Python 2.7** with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) library installed

### Code
Template code was provided in the `robot_motion_planning/robot.py` python file. Additional supporting python code found in `robot_motion_planning/maze.py`, `robot_motion_planning/showmaze.py`, and `robot_motion_planning/tester.py`. Supporting text files for `tester.py` can be found in `test_maze_01.txt`, `test_maze_02.txt`, and `test_maze_03.txt`. While some code has already been implemented, I will implement additional functionality in `robot.py` to successfully complete the project.

### Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `robot_motion_planning/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

`python robot.py` \
`python -m robot`

This will run the `robot.py` file and execute your agent code.
